# Spam-vs-Not-Spam

spam vs not spam is one of the most resolved machine learning problems so i've tried my best to do my version of it achieving accuracy of 98% 

which is not the best of all results that have achieved before but still you can depend on it :)

This projcet splits to 4 steps:

1 - Loading the data.

2 - Preprocessing.

3 - Train the model.

4 - Test the model.

First , i load the data set -which i will leave its link down- using pandas libirary Then , i did some preorcessing that helps the model to recognize spam and not spam massages 

such as remove stop words , lemmitization , stemming and lower all the words after that , i used tf-idf vectorizer to convert words into numbers that machine learning can handle 

then , i traind the model using the logisitc regression function achieving:

Accuracy   : 0.98

Precision  : 0.99

Recall     : 0.86

Any improvements even small ones will be very appreciated.
